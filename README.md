For students in the ECE346, please fork this repo and work within your own forked repo. 

<!-- To keep your forked repo updated, please fetch upstream everytime when we release a new lab assignment. If you are not familiar of fetch, please checkout this [tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork). -->

# Get Started
## Connected to the robot
The robot can be used as a standalone Ubuntu computer by plugging in a keyboard, a mouse, and a monitor through an HDMI or DP cable. 

On the other hand, you can remote access the robot’s terminal through SSH, given that both robot and the computer are under the same network. If you are connected to the lab’s **ECE346** wifi, we provide detailed [instructions](asset/ssh.md) on how to SSH into the robot with the lab workstation and your laptop.

## Create your private fork
We encourage each group to create a private fork to host your code and make a clone on your group's robot by following this [instruction](asset/private_fork.md). Please add your group number to the name of your private repo.

# [Lab 0 - Introduction](ROS_ws/src/lab0)
The lab 0 gives an introduction to the ROS and robot platform we are using in this class.
