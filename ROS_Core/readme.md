# Main Directory For ROS Package
This directory contains all source codes for the Robot. It divides into two folders, `cpp_ws` and `py_ws`.

`cpp_ws` contains packages for Perception, Localization, and low-level control. ECE346 students can assume them as off-shelves packages and use them as-is.

`py_ws` contains packages for decision-making, which are vital components in this class. We will work on packages in this workspace.
